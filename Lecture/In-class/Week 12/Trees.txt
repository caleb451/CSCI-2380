Notes for Tree Structures

ROOT - the address of the entry point for the tree
CHILDREN - the nodes downstream from any current nodes
        - each node in a binary tree can have ***up to 2 children***
LEVEL - how many connections are needed to reach a node from root
HEIGHT - what is the maximum number of connections needed
        to reach ANY node in the tree (alt. the max LEVEL of the tree)
LEAF NODE - a node with no children


Binary Tree
    Restriction - nodes can only have up to 2 childrenn

Binary Search Tree
    Restrictions - binary tree
                 - child nodes on the left must be less than parent
                 - child nodes on the right must be greater than parent


Build a Binary Search Tree
    - Add in nodes from a list in order of the list
