we want to countdown from n to zero

First, identify the simplest version of this problem
    just start witn n = 0
coutndown(0) will be "0 done"

simplest version has a name - BASE CASE
    We can complete this without iteration (single step)

RECURSIVE CASE 
    How can we reach BASE CASE usign a single step and call the BASE CASE

Consider countdown(start = 1)
    STEP 1: Complete one step of solution (here, print "1")
    STEP 2: Do the rest (countdown(0) <=== BASE CASE)
